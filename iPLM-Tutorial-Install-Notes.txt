To Whom It May Concern,

I attemtped to "downgrade" PiServer from 3.1.2->2.36.0, but the 2.36.0 server would would
not start so reinstalled 3.1.2 which trashed my Neo4j database forcing me to reinstall
the iPLM Tutorial database. Since I leverage separate machines for iPLM and Helix a
three step approach was required:

1. Re-Install the Pi Database on bthompson-c7.8-iplm
	as root:
        service piserver stop
	cd /usr/share/mdx/products/piextras/install_scripts/server
        ./import_pi_tutorial.bash -d P4
        systemctl stop p4d   (Stop the p4d service started by the script above)

        NOTE: This script also creates a p4d server at this path:
       		/usr/share/mdx/repos/p4

              A Perforce Checkpoint of this database and Perforce archive files
              have been copied to this location on bthompson-c7.8-helix:
			/data/perforce/CheckPoint/
			/data/perforce/Backup/
	      This checkpoint and tar of the Archive files can be used to reseed the
              Perforce database to align with the PiServer (Neo4j) database.

2. Re-Install the Perforce Database on bthompson-c7.8-helix
	As root:
         	systemctl stop p4d
  	As perforce:
        	cd /data/perforce/db
		mkdir Backup.<date>
                cd Backup.<date>
                mv ../db.* .
             	mv ../journal .
 		mv ../log .
                cd ..
		p4d -r . -jr -z /data/perforce/CheckPoint/p4d_backup_bthompson-c7.8-iplm.perforce.com.ckp.1.gz
                mv mdx_test mdx_test.SAV
		tar xvf ../../Backup/mdx_test.tar   	
	As root:
         	systemctl start p4d	
	As perforce:
		p4 verify -qz //mdx_test/...

3. Fix the Modified WS STATUS indicator and the Conflict with IP tutorial.gen_dig 

   "pi ws st -v" gives a "Modified" WS STATUS for some of the Tutorial IP's which is "by design", but
    annoying none the less. The issues is related to the tutorial.gen_dig shows a workspace conflict.
    The "pi ip tree" command is a good way to view the enitire heiarchy to look for the offending Version.

	pi ip tree tutorial.tutorial | grep tutorial.gen_dig
	(c1) The IP 'tutorial.gen_dig' occurs with the following versions: LATEST.TRUNK [@2], 1.TRUNK.
     	
    The various IP's in the Tutorial design reference TWO different Versions of the tutorial.gen_dig
    IP, so when the workspace is created, one version "wins" over the other. Hence, the conflict.

    RESOLUTION:
        	The tutorial.tutorial must be changed to reference the SAME Verions of tutorial.gen_dig
                throughout the IP heirarchy:
 		pi ip edit tutorial.cpu
		<Change tutorial.gen_dig@LATEST.TRUNK to tutorial.gen_dig@1.TRUNK>
		pi ip edit tutorial.digital_top
		pi ip edit tutorial.tutorial
    NOTE: This procedue may not include all the steps as it took me awhile to get a clean "pi ip load"
          (In fact, I ended up removing the tutorial.cpu IP altogehter befor the "pi ws st -v" command
           gave a clean report)

NOTE: Disccused downgrade of PiServer with Rien and this is not recommended. Downgrade
      of PiCache is perfectly legit
